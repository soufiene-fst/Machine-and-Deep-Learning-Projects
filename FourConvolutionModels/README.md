# Comparing Different CNN Models for Cats vs. Dogs Classification
This is a [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shibinjudah/4-models-cnn-image-augmentation-transfer-learning) where I have experimented with four different convolutional neural network (CNN) models for a classic binary classification problem: cats vs. dogs. The notebook includes the following models:

* **Model 1:** A basic deep learning model
* **Model 2:** A deep learning model with a data augmentation layer
* **Model 3:** A transfer learning model using EfficientNet
* **Model 4:** A deep learning model with a data augmentation layer and transfer learning using EfficientNet

I have used two different types of datasets for this experiment, both of which are available on Kaggle:

* The Kaggle [Cats vs. Dogs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shaunthesheep/microsoft-catsvsdogs-dataset) created by Microsoft, 
which contains 25,000 images of cats and dogs in a 80:20 split.
* Another Kaggle [Cats vs. Dogs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chetankv/dogs-cats-images), which contains 10,000 images of cats and dogs in a 80:20 split.

## Dependencies
The notebook uses the following dependencies:

* TensorFlow 2.x
* Keras
* EfficientNet
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Pandas

These dependencies are already pre-installed in the Kaggle environment.

## Usage
The notebook is divided into multiple sections, each of which corresponds to a different CNN model. The notebook includes detailed instructions on how to train and evaluate each model, and how to use data augmentation and transfer learning to improve model accuracy.

## Conclusion
This Kaggle notebook demonstrates my experimentation with four different CNN models for classifying cats vs. dogs. 
I have used popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras, and have included techniques such as data 
augmentation and transfer learning to improve model accuracy. The notebook includes both Kaggle datasets for comparison. 
The notebook is easy to use and can be a helpful resource for anyone interested in deep learning and computer vision.
